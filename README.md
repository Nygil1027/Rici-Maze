The start of something
/* This is the first deposit on this repository. I am at the very beginning of programming. I am familiar wiht HTML, Css, I'm working on my JavaScript as we speak and I am also attending Bloc. I feel that I may have jumped the gun with Bloc. I suspended my classes for a month to go back to the basics. Meaning I ran back to codecademy as fast as I could just to reinforce my shakey foundation.
